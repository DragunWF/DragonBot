## Description:

Hello! This was my first big Python project. I was quite new to programming when I made it so you can
pretty much guess already that you're going to see a lot of terrible code here; but nonetheless it was
a good learning experience for me.

This bot pretty much won't get anymore updates since I mainly moved on now to programming a different discord bot in JavaScript. Namely [Ancalagon](https://github.com/DragunWF/Ancalagon).
